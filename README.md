# Practice (2)
Given two directed networks, network 1 and 2
### 1. Calculate the in-degree sequence and out-degree sequence of them.
### 2. Check their connectivity
i.e. strongly or weakly connected.
### 3. Calculate the distance between node a and node i.
### 4. List one subgraph containing at least 5 nodes for each network. 
(The listed subgraphs must be weakly connected.)
